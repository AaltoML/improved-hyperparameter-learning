The benchmarking setup is built on top of [Bayesian benchmarks](https://github.com/secondmind-labs/bayesian_benchmarks/). See instructions in the "Reproduce results in the paper" section in the main page on how to use the code here.

We added models for Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation, Variational Inference and Our hybrid training procedure in the `bayesian_benchmark/models` folder.
