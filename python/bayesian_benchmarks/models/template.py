"""
To add a model, create a new directory in bayesian_benchmarks.models (here) and make file models.py containing at
least one of the classes below.

Model usage is similar to sklearn. For regression:

model = RegressionModel(is_test=False)
model.fit(X, Y)
mean, var = model.predict(X_test)  # first two moments of the posterior
samples = model.sample(X_test, S)  # samples from the posterior

For classification:
model = ClassificationModel(K, is_test=False)  # K is the number of classes
model.fit(X, Y)
p = model.predict(X_test)          # predictive probabilities for each class (i.e. onehot)

It should be feasible to call fit and predict many times (e.g. avoid rebuilding a tensorflow graph on each call).
